======
This year, on April 19, 2024, I graduated in computer engineering from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. At this point I had a choice to make, or I started the masterclass immediately, with the advantage of speeding up but with the disadvantage that I should immediately go back to study and I missed half of the lessons and the first semester. Or I could start my master‚Äôs course in October from the beginning but I could work/study something else. Since in my field of work, but in general in the world, it is necessary to study and know English I thought to use my savings to leave for 2 months in a place where I could learn English. After several researches I concluded that the best option was bristol, a small town in uk not too far from London, very lively and quiet at the same time. Also a work experience would definitely have been a very good option, but I concluded that putting myself 6 months to work for 8/9 hours a day was not what I wanted at the moment. Besides that I also thought that learning a language is an activity that requires a lot of effort and the more you go on with age and the more difficult it becomes. Not to mention that once the masterclass is over, I definitely won‚Äôt go abroad to study English but I‚Äôll want to start working right away. The plan is then to spend two intense months in Bristol and then go back to Italy and study to benefit the subjects I will have in October at university.

======

In general these trips include going to live in a family, to go to school to follow the lessons and various activities organized by the school and not. in my case I came into a family of mother and son, of Jamaican origin. And I must say that I was very lucky because they are clean, they cook most of the time well and the house is not too far from school or the center of bristol. The lessons are very creative and we can speak with a lot of people from different parts of the world. The association that i choose its EF (Educational First) that is one of the most popular association for learn english and travel. So in total i have to stay here 9 weeks and at the end the school gives me a certificate.

Before I finish I want to say one last thing. Among the various things I want to try to write in English, both as training, and so that it can reach as many people as possible. That said, I promise nothing about fairness üòÅ. The second is that I hope it‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs starting to go into fashion, this one about opening personal sites, I think it‚Äôs very nice.
