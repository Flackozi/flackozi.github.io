Hey! Iâ€™m Flavio, a software engineering student at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. This website is dedicated to learning and sharing. Here, youâ€™ll find ideas, insights, and notes/articles meant to help me learn something new.

<span style="color: #ce2323">What's this website about?</span>
======
On this website, Iâ€™ll primarily be sharing things Iâ€™m learning in my spare time.
- System design  
- Machine learning  
- and more

These resources are mainly for my personal learning, but I thought it would be good to share them publicly. This way, I have something to keep myself accountable, and I can engage in meaningful discussions with interesting people.

======

I really enjoy writing, so Iâ€™ll maintain a small blog where I discuss everything related to my career and provide updates on all the exciting things Iâ€™m learning!
